## Recommended Implementation for Your Website

For your educational institute website, I recommend **Disqus** because:

1. **Easy Integration**: Just add a few lines of code
2. **Professional**: Trusted by millions of websites
3. **Moderation**: Good tools to manage inappropriate comments
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Works well on all devices
5. **Free Tier**: Good for getting started

### How to Add Disqus to Your React Website:

1. **Sign up** at https://disqus.com/
2. **Create a new site** and get your shortname
3. **Install the React component**:
   ```bash
   npm install disqus-react
   ```

4. **Add to your pages** (example for course pages):
   ```jsx
   import { DiscussionEmbed } from 'disqus-react';

   const CourseComments = ({ courseId, courseTitle }) => {
     const disqusShortname = 'your-site-shortname';
     const disqusConfig = {
       url: window.location.href,
       identifier: `course-${courseId}`,
       title: courseTitle,
     };

     return (
       <div className="mt-8">
         <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Comments & Discussion</h3>
         <DiscussionEmbed
           shortname={disqusShortname}
           config={disqusConfig}
         />
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

5. **Add to your course detail pages**:
   ```jsx
   <CourseComments 
     courseId={course.id} 
     courseTitle={course.name} 
   />
   ```

This will give you a professional commenting system where students can:
- Ask questions about courses
- Share experiences
- Get help from other students
- Provide feedback

The comments are stored on Disqus servers, so you don't need to manage a database for comments.
